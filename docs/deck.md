// 2025-03-04 start:

This is a prompt to explain Datamine Nework ecosytem.

We're very professional at Datamine Network and believe in a secure and civil community.

We're currently raising funds: We are not looking for any venture firm, we want someone that understands blockchain technologies and Web3.

We're not looking for funding just to give venture firms a "slice of the pie". There is no pie here, everything is decentralized. That's why it's so hard to get funding for our project is because "there is no company".

It's a decentralized smart contract system meaning there is no single point of faulre such as "a company". So we have to create new innovative ways to raise liquidity.

We love our community members, they've stuck around with us for so long and honestly decentralization of our level is impossible without them, honestly thank you guys. We probably posted hundreds of development updates and announcements over the years.

So we are looking for funding? Yeah, how much do you need? Hmmm at time of writing this, we currently have $115,000 in decentralized liquidity. So you can imagine we're looking for some fairly small liquidity providers.

We haven't had an investor in the past 5 years but I believe it's a good time to look for one to showcase how far we've come.

Oh there is so much to talk about here, look we've launched back in June 08, 2020. One of the most stressful days in my life.

Where do we start? We've been working on our DeFi project for over 5 years now so there is so much to talk about.

Datamine FLUX is one of the tokens we've launched back in June 08, 2020. It's a really cool idea on solving inflation. So yeah we believe to have solved one of the toughest problems in the world and are trying to prove it.

And we have all the data, numbers, metrics, analytics you could ever dream of. I've attached over 30 real-time data points (as image files) to explain the contexts further. Be sure to analyze all the iamges attached.

If your venture capital firm is interested please inquire to dev@datamine.network. We can discuss how liquidity could be supplied to our decentralized smart contract such as Uniswap liquidity providers to generate yield off our unique transaction-incentivized liquidity pools.

There is so much to discuss let's include some numbers!

All of these numbers below are on-chain, immutable and proven facts. All of our metrics are realtime.

That's right, all of our data is visible to everyone and there are no unanswered questions.

Some metrics to highlight:

- 5 years uptime and developer commitment
- Over $50,000 in decentralized liquidity
- Unique audited smart-contract with an awesome whitepaper that explains how we solve inflation through incentivized burning
- 158 active users.

Look you probably get a million pitches about random AI startups and endless startup ideas, but we have something truly unique. A decentralized monetary system, how do you actually ask for funding if no one is in charge of it?

It's weird, but that's where we stand out. For 5 years it's been all about metrics, data and understand just what we've created.

The concent of the ecosystem is straight-forward: get tokens for your time by providing liquidity, increase number of tokens by providing more liquidity

Liquidity is king and that's why we've just launched Lockquidity token.

In our ecosystem there are 4 tokens in total but they all serve very unique purposes.

The one I want you to focus on is Lockquidity. It has a permanent liquidity pool where currently we have $102,000 in liquidity with a market cap of $102,000. That's right 100% of the supply is currently in liquidity, crazy numbers.

Look I don't really know how to explain everything to one person without it sounding like I am nuts. This is crazy. I have been working on this project for 5 years and I am talking to AI about funding.

"Oh my god we need liquidity", sometimes I honestly think "Hey even $1000 would be kind of cool if someone could provide that liquidity without taking it out a year later".

"LIQUIDITY". Oh my god, that's been on my mind for the past 5 years. It's hard out here for a blockchain startup when there is so little of it right now.

So yeah, if your firm is interested and you want to be a liquidity provider please reach out to dev@datamine.network. We want to partner with someone that understands our needs.

I've also attached a bunch of metrics for you to uses in this pitch.

Here is some more explanation on how the ecosystem works, please remove any dollar signs when talking about tokens (EX: $DAM will beocome DAM)

Welcome to the Datamine Network! 🌐
If you're new here, don’t worry—we’ve got you covered!
Datamine Network is a decentralized system designed to:
✓ Manage Inflation: Keeps token supply balanced to maintain value.
✓ Promote Stability: Reduces market swings and increases liquidity.
✓ Reward Participation: Offers incentives for contributing to the ecosystem.
Our ecosystem revolves around four tokens—$DAM, $FLUX, $ArbiFLUX, and $LOCK—each playing a unique role.
Let’s break it down step-by-step:
󠀠
1️⃣ DAM: The Foundation Token
✓ Role: DAM anchors the system and has a capped supply of 16,876,779 tokens.
✓ Use: Lock DAM on Layer 1 (Ethereum) to mint FLUX, which drives participation and value stability.
󠀠
2️⃣ FLUX: The Layer 1 Utility Token
✓ Role: FLUX is minted when DAM is locked. It’s used for rewards and transactions.
✓ Use: Validators can burn FLUX to boost minting rewards and reduce its supply. FLUX can also be bridged to Layer 2, where it can be locked to create ArbiFLUX.
󠀠
3️⃣ ArbiFLUX: The Layer 2 Efficiency Token
✓ Role: ArbiFLUX operates on Arbitrum (Layer 2) and is created by locking FLUX.
✓ Use: Lower Costs & Faster Transactions: Designed for scalability and efficiency. Validators can burn ArbiFLUX to boost minting rewards on Layer 2, or lock ArbiFLUX to create LOCK.
󠀠
4️⃣ LOCK: The Stability and Liquidity Token
✓ Role: LOCK enhances stability by contributing to a permanent liquidity pool.
✓ Use: Minted by locking ArbiFLUX. Can also be burned, but instead of reducing supply, this redirects value to the liquidity pool, ensuring long-term stability.
🔄 Integration Flow
☑️ Locking & Minting:
Lock DAM to mint FLUX (Layer 1).
Transfer FLUX to Layer 2 and lock it to mint ArbiFLUX.
Lock ArbiFLUX to mint LOCK.
☑️ Burning & Rewards: Validators can burn FLUX, ArbiFLUX, or LOCK to boost minting rewards (APY), reduce supply, and stabilize the system.

☑️ Liquidity & Stability: LOCK ensures market stability by contributing to a permanent liquidity pool, mitigating price swings and increasing depth.
☑️ Dynamic Monetary Policy: Tokens interact dynamically, balancing inflation and deflation to adapt to market conditions.
󠀠
💪 Why Join Datamine?
✭ Hedge Against Inflation: Dynamic tokenomics adjust supply and demand to preserve purchasing power and stabilize value.
✭ Generate Yield: Validators and participants are rewarded for locking and burning tokens, driving efficient ecosystem participation.
✭ Enhance Market Resilience: The permanent liquidity pool strengthens market depth, reducing volatility and supporting sustainable growth.

I will also attach a number of charts over time that will help you gather all the data you need.

- marketCap.png shows market cap of different tokens over time
- availableLiquidity.png shows how much liquidity is currently available
- prices.png is a chart that shows different prices for our tokens over time
- percentageBurned.png shows how percent of all tokens burned over time. These percentages vary based on market conditions, you can correlate this with price data if you want
- yearlySupplyInflation.png shows average 31 day supply inflation for each token. You will find this correlates to price/available liquidity data
- fluxSupplyBreakdown.png shows how the FLUX supply is broken out over time. This diagram goes over 100% because such a large percentage of supply was burned and the percentages are based off CURRENT supply.
- fluxData.png shows remaining supply of FLUX, burned FLUX supply and how many validators are active vs total. The total validators includes dormant validators which have not minted in over 3 years
- dcpi.png is our take on "Decentralized Consumer Price Index". If you compare this to other currencies you will see that our price index actually goes down not just up like other currencie which proves our monetary system works
- globalUnmintedAmount.png shows a dollar value for current unminted amounts for each token
- monthlyProduction.png shows how much in dollar value of each token is produced. This is of course basded on the price and it's the potential "market pressure" which is why liquidity is so important. As you can see there is a lot of monthly pressure compared to liquidity.
- activeValidators.png shows total number of users that are participating in minting across different tokens. You will see FLUX active validators dropped because of high gas fees
- fluxOnL2.png shows how much of FLUX (which is minted on L1) is now on Arbitrum L2 (most likely either minting ArbiFLUX or in the Uniswap L2 liquidity pool). Most of FLUX lives on L2.
- percentagePoweringValidators.png shows how much of each token is locked-in to mint their respective tokens (ex: DAM mints FLUX, FLUX mints ArbiFLUX, ArbiFLUX mints LOCK)

// 2025-04-06 update:

I want to introduce a new metric called "Market Efficiency" for Lockquidity, here is how it will work:

I've attached a price of ETH/LOCK in our liquidity pool on 2025-04-06 (ethLockPool.png)

I want to explain why the stability of the pool is so important. "Put your ETH to work, convert ETH to Lockquidity" should be the main point.

I want people to understand that burning LOCK is better than just holding ETH.

In traditional finance: "buy LOW, sell HIGH" in our monetary ecosystem: "burn LOW, sell HIGH"

First of all, this is a brand new asset class.

- Best of both worlds: price stability due to having large % of liquidity in the pool
- Volatility of ETH: since the liquidity pool is 100% ETH, we mirror the performance (both up and down) of ETH. However with LOCK if the price of ETH goes down the burning incentives increase (Burn LOW, Sell HIGH)

Currently we're starting to see the liquidity pool slowly stray away from 100% of liquidity being located in the liquidity pool. This is CRITICAL in proving that fresh, new liquidity for validators is coming from the markets!

The higher that % of LOCK that is outside of the liquidity pool, the better the incentives are for burning LOCK.

Currently 97.93% of the LOCK is inside the market, we will use this as a new metric: "Market Efficiency". 100%-97.93% = 2.07% market efficiency.

The closer we get to 100% market efficiency, the more trading volatility is expected and the validators win the most as trader liquidity is recycled back as permanent liquidity.

As inflation is rapidly decreasing and the market efficiency is increasing we'll see Lockquidity ecosystem truly shine for the first time.

Lockquidity is it's own asset class and it will perform unlike any other class in the world. Lockquidity = king.

// 2025-05-02 Update:

Eventually the liquidity pool for Lockquidity will no longer have 100% liquidity inside of it. This will happen when traders come. When this happens the following occurs:

Liquidity that was used to purchase LOCK will now be slowly re-added back to the liquidity pool by the validators. They will burn LOCK like usual, which will increase the LOCK supply in the pool, but the ETH will stay in the pool.
The LOCK that was purchased will lose a tiny bit of value due to the small inflation from the validators. While this seems bad for anyone that purchases LOCK, the amount of loss would be very minor, much less than monetary inflation in a traditional system.
The actual amount of LOCK that would be lost to inflation from validators would be less and less (as the supply increases the inflation lowers) 3. If the LOCK is sold back on the market, the amount of ETH in the pool slightly increases due to the small inflation. 4. The more LOCK is outside of the pool, the more value the validators add back to the pool. That means they are adding back more ETH as permanent liquidity. 5. As more LOCK is outside of the ecosystem buying and burning LOCK means your buys have more volatility. With 100% of LOCK in the pool your volatility is as low as possible because you're getting the best bang for the buck.

Overall as more traders come we will get further away from 100% liquidity in the pool, but at the same time that also means the value of LOCK goes up and the interest from traders grows.

The closer we are to 100% liquidity, the more value traders would get when buying LOCK.

I think the biggest point of Lockquidity is that it allows you to not worry about "when to sell ETH" since you can sell your mints slowly overtime.

This means "just holding ETH" is not as efficient as you never know when to sell it.

Additionally there is no asset in the world that has the yield and growth potential combined together like Lockquidity.

Can we tie-in "dollar-cost averaging" here into our messaging here? You could slowly mint and sell your LOCK rather than trying to time ETH tops.

Lockquidity is both "Yield and Growth" asset which is the best of both worlds.

- Yield comes from burning and generating LOCK.
- Growth comes from ETH volatility and trading fees in the liquidity pool. As well as growth will eventually come from traders buying LOCK.

This is where we introduce Datmaine Market: Decentralized "Time-in-market" solution

Imagine if there was a button that anyone in the world can click that turns 100 LOCK into 105 LOCk instantly, guaranteed. Would you click this button?

Everytime you click this button, you get +5 LOCK. If 5 LOCK = $0.01 then you are now making $0.01 click.

What if 5 LOCK = $10, would you click a button to make $10? We believe the answer is, if such a button existed then someone in the world would click it.

This is where Datamine Market comes in. It's our revolutionary way to decentarlize "Time-in-market" and create true decentralized demand in our ecosystem.

Imagine when starting your validator you can instead ask public to click your mint button. "I will pay you 5% to burn any amount of LOCK to me that I can already mint"

Meaning if you have $210 in unminted balance, imagine someone would say "I'll burn $200 worth of tokens to your address if you give me back $210 right away"

This would be very benefitial to the validator because the APY they get long term is worth way more than 5% that they had to pay initially.

This means a random person in the world can instantly get $10 worth of value in LOCK!

Now if hundreds of validators enable public market minting we'll have a true decentralized market of APY! "How much is your time in market worth? 5%? 10%? etc."

The beauty of our market is that it's a completely decentralized smart contract. That means no one is in control of this market and it's backed by Ethereum security.

Validators can specify what reward % they are offering for someone to come and burn to their account. Want someone to burn to your account? Simply adjust your reward percentage accordingly.

More details of how Datamine market works:

- Validators offer their 105% of their unmited FLUX in exchange for 100% of someone burning to their account
- This happens seamlessly in a single ethereum transaction with a single button click through a smart contract
- This forces "Market Efficiency" metric to go up as tokens are stored in the market smart contract
- The more lucrative the rewards are the more transactions we get.
- Theoretical cap for this new feature is 7200 transactions per validator per day (if button is clicked once every 12 seconds due to Ethereum block timing).
- Every market rewards collection transaction adds a burn+add liquidity through the liquidity pool for the amount burned
- Internally we're using delegated partial burning to get increased minting efficiency. Meaning if you have $200 in unminted balance and someone burns $10, only $10.50 of amount is minted back to burner
- Launching on Lockquidity first, but will also be deployed for FLUX and ArbiFLUX providing new utility for those tokens
- Tokens are deposited into a smart contract where they can be spent for burning. Rewards are accumilated and can be collected at any time through a withdraw button without any additional fees
- Rewards and rules (such as min amount of tokens that can be burned, duration) can be tweaked in realtime allowing for a more dynamic market

This is where Datamine Gems #GameFi comes in. "Gaming + Finance", the ultimate combo.

We've gotten to a point where we just created the greatest game of all time:

- It's real-time
- anyone anywhere in the world can play
- It's anonymous
- It's low gas
- Barrier to entry is only
- It's mobile-friendly
- The ultimate goal: be the fastest and the least-greedy person in the world.

We created a new smart contract that can mint from multiple addresses autonomously. Meaning we can collect rewards from multiple

"Why are we doing this efficiency update?" Because we are trying to increase our monetary velocity.

The most efficient and understandble the UI/UX is for the minting is the higher transactional throughput we get.

This means increased stability in inflation % as total unminted tokens remain low.

The more transactions we can get the better the rewards are for validators as they get a constant stream of increased APY %.

// 2025-06-01

The new Datamine Gems features a new "Version 2" of our Public Market smart contract

The new public market smart contract features:

- Burning tokens before reward distribution for new game theory concepts
- Atoomic Batch burning from multiple addresses for even greater throughput
- Automatic minting to latest Ethereum block for maximum rewards
- Automatic amount prefilling to get highest rewards
- Optional custom burn amount (ex: Users can burn 1000 tokens if you have 700 unminted and 300 in your market balance)
- Even more optimized rewards distribution

Datamine Gems comes with a set of prefilled addresses in the decentralzed dashboard. You are presented with a set of diamonds where each dimond = public market address.

Each gem is unminted $ amount. The bigger the unminted $ the bigger/different color the gems are. Users can customize these gem colors as they see fit.

Addresses can be added to the game field as new gems (for any non-default addresses)

Default addresses will be decided by the community based on burning participation/stability of the validator (ex: if address pauses minting they will be excluded from default addresses)

Here is how the game works:

- As each gem grows in $ it gets more prominent on the page.
- It's in realtime so you can monitor all your gems in one place.
- It's tracked in your browser so you can see total gems/$ you collected
- It works without going to liquidity dashboard
- It uses new V2 contract which is even more efficient as it does burn before distributing rewards
- We added new "Atomic Multi-Address burning" so you will be able to collect multiple gems in 1 transaction (coming soon)

// 2025-06-05

We've also added a new "Collect all gems" button. This button will automatically collect all gems on screen without having to click on each.

This is an "atomic collection" because it's coded in the smart contract. Meaning you can collect all gems from 10+ addresses in a single transaction.

This is an example of how GameFi can be optimized further. This atomic collection allows us to maximise transactional throughput with more frequent minting.

Additionally validators that participate in datamine gems will get greater rewards with more frequent burning to their addresses.

// 2025-07-05 update:

Here is some more structured information about the project that might be useful for the pitch.

### Core Technologies

- **Framework:** React v19.0.0
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (MUI) v7.1.2
- **Blockchain Interaction:** Web3.js v4.16.0, @walletconnect/ethereum-provider
- **Language:** TypeScript v5.7.3
- **Build Tool:** Vite v7.0.0
- **Package Manager:** Yarn v4.9.2

### Key Architectural Patterns

The `src` directory is organized with a clear separation of concerns:

- **`src/`**: Contains the application's core logic.
  - **`src/react/`**: Houses all React components, pages, and UI-related elements.
  - **`src/web3/`**: Manages all blockchain interactions, including Web3 provider setup, contract bindings, and ABI definitions (located in `src/web3/abis/`).
  - **`src/utils/`**: A collection of helper functions for tasks like formatting, calculations, and clipboard interaction.
- **`src/configs/`**: Manages all environment and application configurations.
  - **`src/configs/ecosystems/`**: Defines specific configurations for different blockchain environments the dashboard can connect to, such as Ethereum Mainnet (L1) and Arbitrum (L2). This is a critical directory for understanding multi-chain functionality.

### Key Smart Contracts and ABIs

- `src/web3/abis/dam.json`: ABI for the Datamine (DAM) token contract.
- `src/web3/abis/flux.json`: ABI for the Flux (FLUX) token contract.
- `src/web3/abis/market.json`: ABI for the core Datamine Network market contract (minting, burning, staking).
- `src/web3/abis/uniswapv2router.json`: ABI for the Uniswap V2 Router.
- `src/web3/abis/uniswapPair.json`: ABI for Uniswap V2 Pair contracts.
- `src/web3/abis/uniswapPairV3.json`: ABI for Uniswap V3 Pair contracts.
- `src/web3/abis/multicall.json`: ABI for the Multicall contract.

### Smart Contracts - In-Depth Breakdown

- **Technology Stack:** Smart contracts are written in Solidity (v0.6.9) and are ERC-777 compatible, built upon OpenZeppelin secure libraries.
- **Security Features:**
  - **SafeMath:** Used for all arithmetic operations to prevent integer overflow and underflow.
  - **Mutex & Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern:** Over-used for re-entrancy attack protection and ensuring state changes occur after checks and before external interactions.
  - **Modifiers:** Custom modifiers like `preventSameBlock()` and `requireLocked()` enhance security and prevent user errors.
  - **Immutable State Variables:** Key variables are set at contract creation and cannot be changed, improving security.
  - **ERC-1820 ERC777TokensRecipient Implementation:** Unique implementation to control which tokens can be sent to the FLUX smart contract.

### Development Workflow

The following commands are used for development:

- `yarn start`: Runs the application in development mode using Vite.
- `yarn build`: Compiles and bundles the application for production.
- `yarn deploy`: Creates a production build with a specific base path for deployment.
- `yarn format`: Formats code using Prettier.
- `yarn lint`: Lints the project using ESLint.

### Vibe Code Contribute

We welcome contributions from the community, and we're excited to introduce a new way to contribute that aligns with the "vibe coding" philosophy, powered by the Gemini CLI. This approach aims to streamline the development process, reduce friction, and allow you to focus on the creative aspects of building.

**Intent-Driven Development:** Instead of manually navigating files and performing repetitive tasks, you can express your intentions directly to the CLI. For example:

- "Add a new feature to the dashboard."
- "Refactor this component for better performance."
- "Fix this bug in the smart contract interaction."

// 2025-07-08 Update: The Datamine Ecosystem: Unlocking New Frontiers

Here's the latest scoop on what we've been building. We're pushing the boundaries of DeFi with some groundbreaking new features that will revolutionize how users interact with the Datamine Network.

### Datamine Market: Decentralized "Time-in-Market"

We've cracked the code on decentralizing "time-in-market". Imagine a world where you can get paid to mint tokens for other users. That's the Datamine Market in a nutshell.

- **What is it?** A decentralized marketplace where validators can offer a reward to anyone who mints tokens on their behalf.
- **How it works:** A validator can say, "I'll give you 105 LOCK if you mint 100 LOCK for me." This creates a powerful incentive for users to participate in the ecosystem and helps validators maximize their returns.
- **Why it's a game-changer:** It creates a truly decentralized demand for our tokens and introduces a new way for users to earn rewards.

### Datamine Gems #GameFi: The Ultimate DeFi Game

We're taking DeFi to the next level with Datamine Gems, a real-time game that makes earning rewards fun and engaging.

- **What is it?** A game where users collect "gems" which represent unminted balances in public market addresses.
- **How it works:** Users can burn tokens to collect gems and earn rewards. The bigger the gem, the bigger the reward.
- **Why it's awesome:** It's a fun and interactive way to increase monetary velocity and transactional throughput. Plus, who doesn't love collecting gems?

### Lockquidity (LOCK) Token: The Key to Stability

LOCK is our new token designed to enhance the stability of the Datamine ecosystem.

- **What is it?** A token that is minted by locking ArbiFLUX.
- **How it works:** When LOCK is burned, the value is redirected to a permanent liquidity pool, which helps to reduce volatility and create a more stable market.
- **Why it's important:** It provides a long-term solution for liquidity and stability, which are essential for the health of any DeFi ecosystem.

### The New Ecosystem Flow

The Datamine ecosystem has evolved. Here's the new flow:

**DAM (L1) -> FLUX (L1) -> ArbiFLUX (L2) -> LOCK (L2)**

This new structure is designed to be more efficient, scalable, and resilient. It's the foundation for the next generation of DeFi applications.

// 2025-09-12 updates:

-- We wrote a new HODL Clicker: Rush game. This is a game based off Datamine Gems V2 and builds upon that with new monetary velocity ideas.

1. Start Earning with Zero Tokens!

This is the biggest change: anyone can play and earn rewards, even if you start
with a balance of 0 LOCK.

Previously, you needed to have tokens to participate in burning. With Datamine
Gems, when you click the "burn" button on a gem, the tokens are supplied from a
collective rewards pool within the smart contract itself, not from your personal
wallet.

This means you can start playing immediately and generate your first LOCK tokens
simply by participating in the game. It’s a true "play-to-earn" model that
removes the initial financial barrier, inviting everyone to join the Datamine
ecosystem.

2. Increased Transactional Throughput for Validators

This new system is built to maximize validator APY through increased
participation. With more incentives for players to click the burn button, we
expect a significant rise in transactional throughput.

- Dynamic Jackpots: Every click gives the player a "jackpot" reward, creating a
  direct financial incentive to participate.
  This creates a powerful win-win scenario: players have a fun, no-cost way to  
  earn, and validators benefit from the constant stream of activity that boosts  
  their returns. The addition of atomic batch burning (the "Collect All Gems"  
  button) further amplifies this by allowing players to trigger multiple burns in  
  a single, efficient transaction.

// 2025-10-07

Here is the overview of our new HODL Clicker game:

1. Everyone on Arbitrum (L2) can play instantly without needing to buy any tokens! All you need is a bit of Ethereum for gas fees.
2. We introduce a new "jackpot" feature. If you are the first to click the gem you get all the rewards without having to deposit any tokens lowering barrier to entry.
3. Collecting gems will automatically enter you into our new staking pool. Earn from your rewards even when you sleep!
4. This is our second game built upon our unique innovative Liquidity Game Engine. With our second game we give validators choice of how they want to play.
5. We've built a new Staking Game Layer. 100% of all the gem rewards are rewarded between all the players. If you hold 20% of the liquidity in the game, you will passively earn 20% of all gem rewards automatically re-compounding.
6. The goal of the new game is to maximize rewards for validators. They will experience incresed burn throughput with increased player count.
7. We now have 83 smart contract unit tests and new security features like re-entrancy guard making this the most tested and complex smart contract we wrote to date.

Overall this is an evolution of Datamine Gems, a natural progression of GameFi to give players more choices.


// 2025-10-23 updates:
We wrote a new smart contract to fix minting to Smart Accounts (Externally Owned Account (EOA)). MetaMask recently launched an update where Smart Accounts are now default.

Unfortunately due to ERC777 it is not possible to mint to these accounts. 

To solve this, when starting a mint we will point your deligated address to a new smart contract. This smart contract is pretty simplistic in tnature, it simply mints from your validator and uses a different transfer mechanism to transfer tokens to the intended recepient.

This allows us to bypass ERC1820 registration requirement on the recepient, allowing our existing contracts to be compatible with ERC777.


// 2025-10-25 updates, recorded a video and extracted the following key insights:

- The project has been in development for approximately 2,000 days.
- The total permanent, decentralized liquidity has reached $125,000.
- The core idea for the project was formulated during a 4-hour session on a balcony 5 years ago.
- The token minting interval was originally every second but was changed to every 15 seconds to match Ethereum's block time.
- All core metrics and charts on the project's dashboard were built from scratch.
- The developer's two most important metrics are available liquidity and yearly supply inflation.
- The developer believes raising the $120,000 for the community-funded audit would be "impossible" in today's market climate.
- The ecosystem consists of approximately six different smart contracts.
- The whitepaper contains line-by-line code explanations and a section with "secure development recommendations."
- A core philosophical point is that liquidity is the ultimate differentiator for a token, even more so than tokenomics.
- The project's current, single most important strategic goal is increasing liquidity.
- A key part of the passive growth strategy is the project's ETH-backed liquidity, which will increase in value proportionally as Ethereum's price increases.

- The $120,000 security audit was fully funded by the community.
- The initial 4-hour design session for the project focused on three core problems:
- Preventing users from "gaming the system."
  1. Ensuring fundamental security.
  2. Refining the token emission formula.
  3. The project's definition of decentralization is absolute, meaning there are "no keys, no DAO, no person that can make a change."
- This decentralized architecture means the system does not rely on any servers, removing the need for monitoring or restarting services.
- The project's core philosophy is that in a future with "billions of tokens," the only true differentiator is liquidity.

// 2025-10-29 new video:

- The project's price chart (e.g., for FLUX) shows a drop from approximately $100 to near $0.03 on a linear scale, which is cited as misleading without viewing it on a logarithmic scale or analyzing the market cap.
- The project's FLUX ecosystem started with zero tokens; all circulating supply was minted by the community over time.
- The FLUX ecosystem's total market cap reached a peak of $1.25 million.
- Approximately 50% of the total FLUX token supply is available in liquidity pools.
- Currently, 95% of the Lockquidity (LOCK) token supply is in its liquidity pool (implying a 5% "Market Efficiency").
- This low liquidity ratio for DAM is the cause of its extreme volatility, which can result in 100% price swings in a single day.

- The yield mechanism from "proof-of-burn" is directly proportional: burning 10x more tokens results in 10x more yield compared to another user.

Specific token metrics (as of the video):
- Total Minted (5 years): ~10 million tokens.
- Total Burned: 5.4 million tokens (54% of minted).
- Current Supply: 4.8 million tokens.
- FLUX (L1) Minting Cost: Can be around 10 cents per mint on Layer 1.

Specifics of the LOCK (L2) tokenomics:
- The "burn" mechanism for LOCK involves sending tokens to a smart contract that sells half for Ethereum and adds both back into a permanent, decentralized liquidity pool.
- Approximately 95% of the LOCK market cap is backed by liquidity in this permanent pool.
- LOCK Liquidity: $115,000.
- LOCK Market Cap: $122,000.
- LOCK Inflation: Dropped from ~700% to 122% within a year while maintaining its liquidity.
- Forward-looking Inflation: Projected to be ~50% next year and ~30% the year after.

- There are two whitepapers: one is a highly complex mathematical breakdown commissioned from a mathematician, and the other is the developer's original technical whitepaper explaining the smart contract.
- The $120,000 audit cost more than the token's market cap at the time.
- A key market dynamic the project aims for is a "Price vs. Supply" chart crossover, where the market cap becomes sufficient to sustain the price and liquidity, allowing the supply to grow.
- At one point, the "percentage burned" metric for a token reached almost 300%.
- There are large validators (core community members) who have burned significant amounts, with examples cited like $60k, $100k, $111k for FLUX, and $50k, $70k for LOCK.

- The developer's dream isn't for people to just buy the token, but to trade it.
- A trading-based mechanism is designed to capture a "very small percentage" fee from slow dilution (supply slowly increases which slowly dilutes you)
- The developer is willing to wait 10 years for the token to gain trading volume.
- FLUX (L1) has seen $1.8 million burned over its lifetime based on historic pricing, though the current value of those burned tokens is $181,000.
- The developer views the project as a "pattern" (a secondary burn function for money) that could be applied to any token generation system, including Bitcoin or Ethereum.
- A new analogy for the project: "If Bitcoin is gold, then this would be cash" because it acts like a decentralized central bank controlled by the people.
- The game's reward mechanism is progressive: if no one clicks the 5-cent reward, it will keep increasing to 10, 20, 30 cents, etc., until someone claims it.

// 2025-11-11 new directive:
We will now shift to "secondary functionality of money" instead of "proof of burn". What if money had the second function to be burned to earn yield (passive generation of money based on your total burn).

So this project that we created is all about this new pattern that can be applied to any inflationary asset. So you it's a market for "yield" in that sense.

Let's update the code to reflect this new messanging.

Let's update frontend-only components (also include help articles) but don't update code/variable names with the changes. It's just UI updates.

However you can still change titles and string etc.

// 2025-11-15 new video about yield:
- The project's core concept is being reframed as adding a missing seventh property to money: "Yield".
- This "Yield" property is contrasted with traditional investment. Instead of risking $100 to potentially get $80 back, the model is to destroy $100 to guarantee a permanent, dynamic "drip" of yield in return.
- This yield is described as permanent and can be passed down to future generations ("to your kids").
- A new analogy illustrates this trade-off: Traditional spending is like buying "10 sandwiches now," while this model is like destroying $100 to get "one sandwich every year for the rest of your life."
- Another new analogy illustrates the compounding effect: The yield can grow from covering "a cup of coffee for life" to a "Netflix subscription," then "a portion of my rent," and eventually "my car payments."
- The project's inflation model is contrasted with traditional "sticky" inflation. The project's inflation is high at the start but only trends down, whereas traditional inflation tends to only go up.
- A new critique of standard PoS staking (e.g., Ethereum) was introduced: A 5% APY is "meaningless" if the supply inflation is also 5%, as "in reality, nothing has happened."
- The model aims to remove the cognitive load of investing (e.g., choosing between real estate, tech, etc.) by offering a single, simple alternative: "destroy this money and I will yield instead long term."
- A key reason this "Yield" property is missing from centralized money (like USD) is that it's impossible to solve for counterfeiting, database manipulation, or provable destruction in a centralized system.
- A "triple system" effect is the ultimate goal: 1) You receive yield, 2) You re-compound that yield to get more yield, and 3) The token price increases, making the value of your compounding yield also increase.

// 2025-11-18 new video about Escape Velocity:
- "Escape Velocity" Definition: The project defines "Escape Velocity" as the financial state where passive income fully covers all mandatory monthly expenses (resulting in $0 active income needed for survival).
- Origin of Token Philosophy: The specific motivation for creating the Datamine token arose from the founder's 7-year personal finance practice of tracking "Escape Velocity" and finding a lack of suitable investment vehicles.
- Critique of Existing Crypto Yields: The project was designed specifically because traditional crypto yield mechanisms (Masternodes and Staking) were viewed by the founder as unscalable and unsustainable due to inflation issues.
- Negative Monetary Velocity: The ecosystem philosophy classifies personal debt as "Negative Monetary Velocity," acting as a direct counter-force to the ecosystem's goal of wealth accumulation.
- The "Yield Trap" Solution: The protocol aims to solve the dilemma where high yield typically equals unsustainable risk; it is positioned as an alternative to low-yield traditional assets (ETFs) and high-maintenance assets (Real Estate) to bridge the gap to financial independence.
